# Brain-tumor-classification-using-Fine-Tuning
I have used VGG16 as a base model and used optuna for finding the best hyperparameter like number of unfreezed layers, learning_rate, number of layers and units in fc layer.<br>
The accuracy can be increased by adding more unique data for training other then augmented data<br>
It got an accuracy of maximum 83% which can be increased with good resources and good load of labelled data.<br>
